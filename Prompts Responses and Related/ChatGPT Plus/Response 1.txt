<h2>What Are Earth-like Planets?</h2>

<p>Earth-like planets, also known as <b>terrestrial</b> planets, are celestial bodies that share key characteristics with Earth. The most defining feature of an Earth-like planet is the presence of a <b>solid surface</b>, distinguishing them from gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn. These planets are often located in the <b>habitable zone</b> of their star system, meaning they exist in a region where conditions might allow for <b>liquid water</b>.</p>

<h2>The Habitable Zone</h2>

<p>The <b>habitable zone</b> is sometimes called the "<b>Goldilocks zone</b>," because it represents the range of distances from a star where the temperature is just right—not too hot and not too cold—for liquid water to exist on the surface. Planets in this zone have the potential for <b>habitability</b>, though other factors, such as atmospheric composition and planetary gravity, also play critical roles.</p>

<h2>Notable Earth-like Exoplanets</h2>

<h3>Kepler-22b</h3>
<p>Kepler-22b was one of the first exoplanets confirmed to be in a habitable zone. It was discovered by the <b>Kepler Space Telescope</b>, which has identified thousands of <b>exoplanets</b>—planets orbiting stars outside our solar system.</p>

<h3>Proxima Centauri b</h3>
<p>Discovered using <b>ESO’s HARPS</b> telescope, Proxima Centauri b is an exoplanet orbiting the closest known star to the Sun, <b>Proxima Centauri</b>. Scientists are especially interested in this planet because of its proximity to Earth and its potential for habitability.</p>

<h3>TRAPPIST-1 System</h3>
<p>The <b>TRAPPIST-1</b> system contains <b>seven</b> known planets, three of which are in the habitable zone. This planetary system, located about <b>40</b> light-years from Earth, has become a key focus in the search for Earth-like worlds.</p>

<h3>Kepler-186f</h3>
<p>Kepler-186f, sometimes referred to as Earth's "<b>cousin</b>," is one of the most promising exoplanets discovered. It is similar in size to Earth and exists in its star’s <b>habitable zone</b>, making it a strong candidate for potential extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>How Scientists Discover Earth-like Planets</h2>

<p>Scientists use various methods to detect exoplanets and assess their habitability. Some key methods include:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Transit Method:</b> Observing <b>dips in star brightness</b> when a planet passes in front of its star.</li>
    <li><b>Radial Velocity Method:</b> Detecting <b>wobbles in a star’s motion</b> caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet.</li>
    <li><b>Spectroscopy:</b> Analyzing a planet’s <b>chemical composition</b> by studying the light it reflects or emits.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Importance of Studying Earth-like Planets</h2>

<p>Studying Earth-like planets helps scientists understand the potential for <b>extraterrestrial life</b>. By analyzing their <b>atmospheres</b>, surface conditions, and ability to retain liquid water, researchers can assess whether these planets might support life. The discoveries made by space telescopes such as <b>Kepler</b> and the <b>James Webb Space Telescope</b> continue to expand our knowledge of the universe and the possibilities beyond Earth.</p>
